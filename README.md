Problem 2: Theater Seating
	
You run a small theater and each month, you have patrons mail in requests for pre-sale tickets.  
You need to process these ticket requests and either tell them where their party will sit or explain to the patron why you can't complete their order.
 
You have a few rules that you need to follow when you fill the orders
1.	Fill as many orders as possible
2.	Put parties as close to the front as possible.
3.	If there are not enough seats available in the theater to handle a party, tell them "Sorry, we can't handle your party."
4.	Each party must sit in a single row in a single section.  If they won't fit, tell them "Call to split party".
